# Overview
In this assignment, you will extend your A4 project by designing and fabricating (1) a 3D-printed stand for the servo motor and (2) a 3D-printed motor attachment for the ultrasonic sensor. 

- The 3D-printed stand should provide sufficient support such that when the servo is activated, the gearbox does not move. You may make a free-standing structure (e.g., a stand for a table) or an attachment (e.g., an attachment for the Honor7X).
- The 3D-printed attachment for the ultrasonic sensor should either plug directly into the servo's gear peg or onto a propeller and should robustly hold the sensor.

Though not required, we strongly encourage you to use Autodesk Fusion 360 for this assignment (this is what we will be using for in-class exercises and will be able to support on the Discussion forums). Alternative CAD programs include Blendr, Sketchup, Onshape, Tinkercad, and Rhino. If you are confident and experienced with one of these tools and would prefer to use it for this assignment, you can do so.

The midpoint checkin includes submitting draft CAD models of both the stand and ultrasonic attachment.

For the deliverables, you will turn in a video demo, your CAD files (both the raw CAD files and the STLs), pictures of your 3D prints (both failures and successes), and a brief report reflecting on learnings.

Side note: there is a long history of including 3D-printing as an assignment and module in this Ubiquitous Computing class and it is a trend I'd like to continue (thus, this assignment). See, for example, versions of this course by [Shwetak Patel](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/classes/cse590p/?Assignments) and [Mayank Goel](http://www.mayankgoel.courses/teaching/ee590p-fall-2015/#assignments). In addition, computational fabrication is one area of Ubiquitous Computing that Weiser did not really envision but has become a key thread of research within HCI and ubicomp communities (as we will discuss in class).

Where to 3D-Print?
We strongly encourage you to get started on this assignment right away as 3D-printing often requires multiple iterations and the 3D-printers themselves are a constrained resource. We recommend the following places for 3D-printing:

- [UW Co-motion MakerSpace](https://comotion.uw.edu/what-we-do/makerspace/): Most of you received the training to use the UW Co-Motion MakerSpace. The hours are: Sunday-Monday, 2PM-8PM. Note, however, that the MakerSpace is closed this holiday weekend (both Sunday and Monday). 3D prints are charged $0.05/gram. The fulltime staff is quite knowledgeable and helpful.
- [UW Area 01](https://www.washington.edu/area01/): Area 01 is open to any student (a use fee of $25 applies and you must receive on-site training to use the 3D-printer). Hours: open 7-days a week 1-8PM.
- [UW GIX MakerSpace](https://gix.uw.edu/): This MakerSpace is on the eastside in Bellevue's Spring District. We received special permission to use this space. Hours: Mon & Thurs 2-6PM and Sat 12-4PM. 3D prints are charged $0.08/gram.
- MakerSpace of your own choosing: Many of you have contacted me about MakerSpaces at your workplace--please feel free to use them (with company permission, of course).

# Some Helpful Video Tutorials
We will be doing in-class exercises to help get you familiar with Fusion 360 and the basics of CAD modeling; however, here are some video tutorials to explore as well:

- [Autodesk Tutorial, Fusion 360 for Beginners](https://youtu.be/VbSkwvZyU_0).
- [Autodesk Tutorial, Designing and 3D Printing an Enclosure for Arduino Uno](https://youtu.be/E0bhdr84FNU).
- [Liang He, Making a Keychain in Fusion 360](https://youtu.be/EjIOcY0_4Mo).

# Learning Goals
- Learn the basics of the 3D-fabrication workflow (measuring, CAD modeling, slicing, printing, iterating)
- Gain experience building hardware enclosures for an electro-mechanical design
- Gain experience and basic knowledge of a state-of-the-art CAD tool (Autodesk Fusion 360)

As with previous assignments, we expect that you will seek out external sources to help you learn and complete this assignment. Please properly attribute your sources in your report.

# Parts
As with writing code, you are welcome to explore and view as many examples as you would like online (e.g., via YouTube demos, [Thingiverse](http://thingiverse.com/); however, unlike code, if you download an STL file (and not the raw CAD file), then this is more difficult to work with and modify (it can be done but it's not super straightforward--see [this video from Autodesk](https://youtu.be/Uzg0VJuBA9s). about importing STL meshes into Fusion 360).

[5.5 pts] 3D-printed servo stand: The 3D-printed stand should: (i) be sufficiently robust such that the servo base unit does not move during actuations; (ii) tightly hold the servo base; (iii) be designed to lay flat on a surface (e.g., table) or attach to some other object (e.g., top of smartphone, light fixture).

[5.5 pts] 3D-printed servo attachment: The 3D-printed servo attachment should: (i) robustly attach the ultrasonic senor directly to the servo peg or a propeller; (ii) not negatively impact the wiring. 

[3 pts] Creative feature: Add in an additional creative feature to the IoT design. This is wildly open-ended--you can add in a new feature via Android, Arduino + new circuit, or some new physical form. If you decide to 3D-print something for your creative feature, please make sure you prioritize the core parts of this assignment before printing optional parts.
Deliverables
[2 pts] Your CAD model (either a github link or zipped and uploaded to Canvas). Any part of your model that is informed by or copied from the Internet (or other sources) must be properly attributed in your report. If you hosted your model on github (or some other online repo), please include a link to it in your report.

[2 pts] A brief, 1-page report that: (i) provides an overview of your design along with key measurements; (ii) describes your creative feature; (iii) enumerates key struggles and challenges; (v) reflects on what you learned. You should include as many images as you want (at least one) that helps explain your design. Images are free. You need not write in prose (you can bullet point the entire report). Please use headers to clearly separate the four sections of your report.

[2 pts] A brief (2 mins or less) video overview of your design posted to YouTube, Vimeo, or some other cloud service (we will not accept uploaded mp4s directly to Canvas). The video should simply demonstrate the two 3D-prints integrated into a working version of A4 + a demonstration of your creative feature. This can and should be super casual, no editing is necessary. The video can be unlisted or public (your choice). Please include a link to this video in your report.
