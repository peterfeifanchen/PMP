Open SupportCode\Framework-2-Evaluations.py. Finish implementing the EvaluateBinaryClassification 
  methods that are referenced from the framework.

These are methods of the form: Precision(y, yPredicted) -> float

The full list of evaluations to implement includes:

•	A confusion matrix of the types of mistakes the model makes
•	Precision
•	Recall
•	False positive rate
•	False negative rate

You can find the definitions of all of these in the course readings from Hulten chapter 19 (pp 225 - 229).
